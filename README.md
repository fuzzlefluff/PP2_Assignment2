# PP2_Assignment2
An Assignment where we had to create several classes to simulate a parked car getting a ticket scenario. With each class being analogous to it's real life entity. Parking Meter, Parking Ticket, Police Officer and Parked Car. We then called these classes and ran through 3 different car situations with respective parking meters, then printout the results of who got a ticket and for how much.


Made in Eclipse/Java, src will be the raw code, bin is compiled.
